Description: Pharmacy Database built on Oracle

HOW TO RUN:
- Import or reference the classes12.zip library provided by the CS online server
- SSH into your UBC CS account to form a tunnel to use to successfully log into oracle (use Putty,Xmanager,Bash)
	- For cmdline: ssh -l username -L localhost:1522:dbhost.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca:1522 remote.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca
	- For Putty/Xmanager: Create a local outgoing connection on port 1522. Set destination host: dbhost.ugrad.cs.ubc.ca port 1522

NOTES
- Please remember to add extra project files/directories to the .gitignore if you are using an IDE. I have it set up for IntelliJ, but not yet for Eclipse.
